# Prompt Engineering Task for Learn Basics (ID: PE/2507/IN-1)

This repository contains the complete submission for the Prompt Engineering evaluation task. The project demonstrates the use of AI prompts to automate the extraction, structuring, and lesson planning of educational content from Class 8 NCERT Science textbooks.

The entire workflow is encapsulated in a single, self-contained Python script that generates all required output files.

---

## How to Run the Code

This project is designed to be easily runnable. Follow these steps to generate all output files.

1. Prerequisites
You must have Python 3 and the required libraries installed. If not, please run the following command in your terminal:
bash  
    pip install pandas openpyxl


2. Execute the Script
With the prerequisites installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the main Python script:
bash
  python prompt_engineering_submission.py

3. Verify the Output
After the script runs successfully, it will create all the necessary output files in the project directory.

**Files in this Repository**

Here is a description of each file included in this submission:
**prompt_engineering_submission.py:** 
    The primary Python script that contains the entire logic for the project. It is self-contained and simulates the AI model's responses to generate all other output files when executed.
    
**prompts.md: **
    A markdown file containing the two detailed, reusable prompts that were designed for content extraction and study planner generation, as required by the task.
    
**chapter-extract.json: **
    (Output File) A structured JSON file containing the verbatim content extracted from the four NCERT chapters. This file is generated by the Python script.
    
**Copy of Science-sample-output.xlsx: **
    (Output File) A well-formatted Excel sheet generated from the JSON data. This file is used to visually validate the quality and structure of the extracted content.
    
**study_planner.md: **
    (Output File) A comprehensive 12-day study and teaching planner generated by the script based on the extracted content.
    
**knowledge_graph.txt: **
    (Output File) A text-based representation of the knowledge graph, showing the relationships between chapters, topics, sub-topics, and content types.

    
##Technical Details

Language: Python 3
Libraries:
